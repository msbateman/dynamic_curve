query.dynamically.weighted.grades

Description

Individually weight a set of student grades, weighting assignments that each particular student's better assignments more than his or her worse assignments.

Usage

query.dynamically.weighted.grades(grades, percent = 20, base.weights = FALSE, raw.weights = FALSE)

Arguments

grades          a data frame containing grades
percent         the difference in percent between the best and worst
                assignment (default 20)
base.weights    a numeric vector containing the base weights for your grades.
                the default (FALSE) assumes that all assignments are weighted
                equally to begin with
raw.weights     setting this to TRUE will return the dynamic weights as opposed
                to the mean computed with these weights

Details

The first argument should be a data frame consisting exclusively of grades (so exclude the names column).

Examples

final_grades<-query.dynamically.weighted.grades(grades)

# with a shallower adjustment
final_grades<-query.dynamically.weighted.grades(grades, 10)

# with four equally weighted papers and a more heavily weighted final exam
weights<-c(20, 20, 20, 40)
final_grades<-query.dynamically.weighted.grades(grades, 20, weights)

# same as above, to answer a student when a student she asks to what her
# assignments weights came out
query.dynamically.weighted.grades(grades, 20, weights, TRUE)
